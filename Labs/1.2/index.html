    <h1>What's Vis, and Why Do It?</h1>
    <h2>1.1 The Big Picture</h2>
    <p>Visualisation is suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods.
      The design space of possible vis idioms is huge, and includes the considerations of both how to create and how to interact with visual representations.
      Vis design is full of <strong>trade-offs</strong>, and most possibilities in the deisgn space are <em>ineffective</em> for a particular task, so valdiating, the effetiveness of
      a design is both neccessary and difficult. Vis designers must take into account three very different kinds of resource limitations: those of computers,
      of humans, and of displays. Vis usage can be analysed in terms of why the users needs it, what data is shown, and how the idiom is designed.</p>

    <p>The rationale behind many aspects of this definition as a way of getting you to think about the scope of this book, and about visualisation itself:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Why have a human in the decision-making loop?</li>
      <li>Why have a computer in the loop?</li>
      <li>Why use an external representation?</li>
    </ol>
